|Other automated analysis tools|[Link](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/tree/main/.github/workflows)|
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|Evidence for balanced workload: [Contributions](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|354|
|Number of commits: by different people|mithildani: 24, ritwik4690: 14, rishikesh-yelne: 12, therealppk: 8, nehakale8: 7, vanshmehta-7: 5|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|[Issues](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/issues)|
|Issues are being closed|[Closed Issues](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)|
|DOI badge: exists|DOI present in Readme: [DOI](https://zenodo.org/record/7178252)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |[Docs](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/tree/main/docs)|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
|Use of version control tools|Made use of Git|
|Test cases exist|Product Microservice test cases: [Link](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/tree/main/backend/productms/tests), User Microservice test cases: [Link](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/tree/main/backend/userms/tests)|
|Test cases are routinely executed|GitHub Actions: [Link](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/actions)|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|CONTRIBUTING: [Link](https://github.com/mithildani/Auction-Sphere/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
|Chat channel: exists|Slack channel: [Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T03VB79B2GG/C03U705CJ15)|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|Same stack used by everyone. Setup shared so everyone is able to follow the progress and replicate the project locally|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|config files are modified by multiple people||
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|Short release cycles | tasks assigned for versions and versions released|
