|Use of version control tools||
|Use of style checkers ||
|Use of code formatters. ||
|Use of syntax checkers. ||
|Use of code coverage ||
|Other automated analysis tools||
|Test cases exist||
|Test cases are routinely executed||
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up||
|Issues are discussed before they are closed, even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here||
|Chat channel: exists||
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.||
